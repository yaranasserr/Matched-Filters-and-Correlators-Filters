# Matched-Filters-and-Correlators-Filters
Matched filters and correlator filters are two important concepts in signal processing and communication systems.

A matched filter is a filter that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a communication system. It is designed to correlate a received signal with a known reference or template signal. The reference signal is often the transmitted signal that has been distorted by noise or other impairments during transmission. The matched filter aims to extract the original transmitted signal by aligning and correlating it with the received signal. This correlation process enhances the SNR, improving the detection and recovery of the transmitted signal.

A correlator filter, on the other hand, is used to measure the similarity or correlation between two signals. It calculates the cross-correlation between a given input signal and a reference signal. The cross-correlation measures the similarity between the two signals at different time offsets. It provides a measure of how well the input signal matches the reference signal at different time instances. Correlator filters are commonly used in pattern recognition, synchronization, and signal detection applications.

Both matched filters and correlator filters are utilized in various communication systems, such as wireless communications, radar systems, and audio/video processing. They play a crucial role in extracting and detecting signals of interest, enhancing the signal quality, and improving the overall system performance.
